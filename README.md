# Rainfall Prediction Classifier Using Machine Learning

**Author:** [@pathananas2007](https://github.com/pathananas2007)  

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict rainfall in Melbourne using historical weather data. The workflow includes:  
- Data cleaning and filtering  
- Feature engineering (Date â†’ Season)  
- Preprocessing pipelines (scaling + encoding)  
- Model building and hyperparameter tuning for:  
  - Random Forest  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - SVM  
  - KNN  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - XGBoost  
- Model evaluation using **accuracy, confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC curves, and AUC scores**  
- Comparison of models to select the best performer  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **File:** `data final.csv`  
- **Source:** [Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology â€“ Climate Data Online](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/)  
- Contains cleaned weather data for Melbourne, Melbourne Airport, and Watsonia.
